# enforce-template-app
### 2nd app by RGSoC team $we init

## Statement : 
* The Bot will require new Issues and PRs to use the respective templates and fill out their
fields.
* It will check that the template was actually used instead of deleted by ensuring that
keywords are present in the body.

## Details of Implementation :
* The repository on which the bot is to be installed is required to contain an ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md file as well as a PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file
* Upon the opening of an issue or a pull request, the bot is triggered to do the following:
  * It reads the template accordingly (based on whether it is an issue or a pull request that was opened) and then stores the fields present in the template in an array.
  * Then it takes the issue body and checks for the occurence of each of element of the array of template fields in the issue body.
  * It also handles check-boxes markdown which are commonly used in PR templates

## Future Scope :
* We want to enforce certain mandatory fields to necessarily contain some content
* We also want to ensure that the content filled against these fields is relevant and not some random gibberish.
